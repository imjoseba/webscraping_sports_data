# The Pythagorean Expectation

I’m a data analyst📊, but where do I get the data?

There are many ways to get them like public databases:
https://lnkd.in/dXY4ynSC
https://data.gov/
https://lnkd.in/djpUKNbJ
https://datos.gob.es/es/
https://data.europa.eu/es

Or you can also do web scraping with libraries with a name as peculiar as BeautifilSoup. This technique allows me to get data where I want it (or almost), and feel a Indiana Jones ...

In this repository, you can explore the how to scrape three different webs:

    Basketball (Spanish ACB 2023/2024 season from acb.com) 🏀 > ACB_wbscrap.ipynb
    Football players (fbref.com) ⚽️ > fbref_wbscrap.ipynb
    Football match Nott Forest vs Liverpool 02/03/24 (from Whoscored.com) (Season 2018) ⚽️ > whoscored_wbscrap.ipynb

Feel free to dive in and comment what would have done different! 🚀
